        <h2>What is AAC?</h2>
        <p>
            Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) refers to a set of communication methods and tools that are used to supplement or replace speech or writing for individuals who have difficulty with verbal communication. AAC systems can range from low-tech options like picture boards to high-tech devices with speech synthesis capabilities.

        <h2>Importance of AAC</h2>
        <p>
            AAC is essential for individuals who have conditions or disabilities that affect their ability to speak or write. It helps them express their thoughts, needs, and desires, enabling them to communicate effectively with others. AAC can significantly improve their quality of life by providing a means to interact with their environment and engage in social interactions.

        <h2>Types of AAC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Low-Tech AAC</h3>
                <p>
                    Low-tech AAC includes simple tools like communication boards with pictures, symbols, or words that individuals can point to or touch to communicate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>High-Tech AAC</h3>
                <p>
                    High-tech AAC involves electronic devices, such as speech-generating devices (SGDs), tablets, and software applications, that offer text-to-speech and voice output capabilities.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Symbols and Visual Supports</h3>
                <p>
                    Symbols and visual supports play a crucial role in AAC, helping individuals understand and convey messages. They may include PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) and digital symbol libraries.
                </p>
